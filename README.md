A simulator for something resembling billard balls, except for continuous field 
(think physics without magnetics, only electrostatics, and positive charges). 
Built on PyTorch mostly.

Mostly a toy project done from boredom.


## Installing
On this folder:
```sh
pip install .
```

## Usage
To open the GUI
```sh
import fieldbillard
fieldbillard.run()
```
